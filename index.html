		<h1> WELCOME! </h1>
		<ul>
			<li>My name is Bob Ranalli </li>
			
			<li>I am majoring in <strong>computer science</strong> and maybe a 
				little mechanical engineering along the way</li>
			
			<li>Hackers Welcome (but also please don't): 
				<strong>216.166.169.12</strong> </li>
			
			<li>I was born on the east coast, but my family moved to 
				<strong>Bozeman, Montana.</strong> I went to boarding school in
				NH and MA.</li>
			
			<li>I love to write <strong>screenplays</strong> and I am developing 
				a script with the help of a producer from Bob's Burgers. What 
				<em>he</em> doesn't know, is that I have no clue what I'm doing. 
			</li>
